                    Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded by <b>Zeno of Citium</b> in Athens in the
                    early 3rd
                    century BC. It is a philosophy of personal ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on
                    the natural world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to eudaimonia (happiness,
                    or blessedness) is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not allowing oneself to
                    be controlled by the desire for pleasure or by the fear of pain, by using one's mind to understand
                    the world and to do one's part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others fairly
                    and justly.

                    The Stoics are especially known for teaching that "virtue is the only good" for human beings, and
                    those external things—such as health, wealth, and pleasure—are not good or bad in themselves
                    (adiaphora), but have value as "material for virtue to act upon." Alongside Aristotelian ethics, the
                    Stoic tradition forms one of the major founding approaches to virtue ethics. The Stoics also held
                    that certain destructive emotions resulted from errors of judgment, and they believed people should
                    aim to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is "in accordance with nature." Because of this,
                    the Stoics thought the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but
                    how a person behaved. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order
                    since they thought everything was rooted in nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stoicism flourished throughout the Roman and Greek world until the 3rd century AD, and among its
                    adherents was Emperor Marcus Aurelius. It experienced a decline after Christianity became the state
                    religion in the 4th century AD. Since then it has seen revivals, notably in the Renaissance
                    (Neostoicism) and in the contemporary era (modern Stoicism).

                    Ancient stoics are often misunderstood because the terms they used pertained to different concepts
                    than today. The word "stoic" has since come to mean "unemotional" or indifferent to pain because
                    Stoic ethics taught freedom from "passion" by following "reason." The Stoics did not seek to
                    extinguish emotions; rather, they sought to transform them by a resolute "askēsis", that enables a
                    person to develop clear judgment and inner calm. Logic, reflection, and focus were the methods
                    of such self-discipline, temperance is split into self-control, discipline, and modesty.

                    Borrowing from the Cynics, the foundation of Stoic ethics is that good lies in the state of the soul
                    itself; in wisdom and self-control. Stoic ethics stressed the rule: "Follow where reason
                    leads."[citation needed] One must therefore strive to be free of the passions, bearing in mind that
                    the ancient meaning of "passion" was "anguish" or "suffering", that is, "passively" reacting to
                    external events, which is somewhat different from the modern use of the word. A distinction was made
                    between pathos (plural pathe) which is normally translated as passion, propathos or instinctive
                    reaction (e.g., turning pale and trembling when confronted by physical danger) and eupathos, which
                    is the mark of the Stoic sage (sophos). The eupatheia are feelings that result from the correct
                    judgment in the same way that passions result from incorrect judgment.

                    The idea was to be free of suffering through apatheia (Greek: ἀπάθεια; literally, "without passion")
                    or peace of mind, where peace of mind was understood in the ancient sense—being objective or
                    having "clear judgment" and the maintenance of equanimity in the face of life's highs and lows.

                    For the Stoics, reason meant using logic and understanding the processes of nature—the logos or
                    universal reason, inherent in all things. According to reason and virtue, living according to reason
                    and virtue is to live in harmony with the divine order of the universe, in recognition of the common
                    reason and essential value of all people.

                    The four cardinal virtues (aretai) of Stoic philosophy is a classification derived from the
                    teachings of Plato (Republic IV. 426–435):
                <ul class="">
                    <li>Wisdom (Greek: φρόνησις "phronesis" or σοφία "sophia", Latin: prudentia or sapientia)
                    </li>
                    <li>Courage (Greek: ανδρεία "andreia", Latin: fortitudo)
                    </li>
                    <li>Justice (Greek: δικαιοσύνη "dikaiosyne", Latin: iustitia)
                    </li>
                    <li>Temperance (Greek: σωφροσύνη "sophrosyne", Latin: temperantia)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="mb-5">
                    Following Socrates, the Stoics held that unhappiness and evil are the results of human ignorance of
                    the reason in nature. If someone is unkind, it is because they are unaware of their own universal
                    reason, which leads to the conclusion of unkindness. The solution to evil and unhappiness then is
                    the practice of Stoic philosophy: to examine one's own judgments and behavior and determine where
                    they diverge from the universal reason of nature.

                    The Stoics accepted that suicide was permissible for the wise person in circumstances that might
                    prevent them from living a virtuous life. Plutarch held that accepting life under tyranny would
                    have compromised Cato's self-consistency (constantia) as a Stoic and impaired his freedom to make
                    the honorable moral choices. Suicide could be justified if one fell victim to severe pain or
                    disease, but otherwise suicide would usually be seen as a rejection of one's social duty.
