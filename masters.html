                        <p class="card-text">
                            Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (26 April 121 – 17 March 180) was Roman emperor from 161 to 180
                            and a Stoic
                            philosopher. He was the last of the rulers known as the Five Good Emperors (a term coined
                            some 13 centuries later by Niccolò Machiavelli), and the last emperor of the Pax Romana (27
                            BC to 180), an age of relative peace and stability for the Roman Empire. He served as Roman
                            consul in 140, 145, and 161.

                            Marcus was born during the reign of Hadrian to the emperor's nephew, the praetor Marcus
                            Annius Verus, and the heiress Domitia Calvilla. His father died when he was three, and his
                            mother and grandfather raised Marcus. After Hadrian's adoptive son, Aelius Caesar, died in
                            138, the emperor adopted Marcus' uncle Antoninus Pius as his new heir. In turn, Antoninus
                            adopted Marcus and Lucius, the son of Aelius. Hadrian died that year and Antoninus became
                            emperor. Now heir to the throne, Marcus studied Greek and Latin under tutors such as Herodes
                            Atticus and Marcus Cornelius Fronto. He kept in close correspondence with Fronto for many
                            years afterward. Marcus married Antoninus' daughter Faustina in 145. After Antoninus died in
                            161, Marcus acceded to the throne alongside his adoptive brother, who took the name Lucius
                            Verus.

                            The reign of Marcus Aurelius was marked by military conflict. In the East, the Roman Empire
                            fought successfully with a revitalized Parthian Empire and the rebel Kingdom of Armenia.
                            Marcus defeated the Marcomanni, Quadi, and Sarmatian Iazyges in the Marcomannic Wars;
                            however, these and other Germanic peoples began to represent a troubling reality for the
                            Empire. He modified the silver purity of the Roman currency, the denarius. The persecution
                            of Christians in the Roman Empire appears to have increased during Marcus' reign, but his
                            involvement in this is unknown. The Antonine Plague broke out in 165 or 166 and devastated
                            the population of the Roman Empire, causing the deaths of five million people. Lucius Verus
                            may have died from the plague in 169.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            Lucius Annaeus Seneca the Younger (4 BC – AD 65), usually known as Seneca,
                            was a Roman Stoic philosopher, statesman, dramatist, and in one work, satirist from the
                            Silver Age of Latin literature.

                            Seneca was born in Cordoba in Hispania, and raised in Rome, where he was trained in rhetoric
                            and philosophy. His father was Seneca the Elder, his elder brother was Lucius Junius Gallio
                            Annaeanus, and his nephew was the poet Lucan. In AD 41, Seneca was exiled to the island of
                            Corsica under emperor Claudius, but was allowed to return in 49 to become a tutor to
                            Nero. When Nero became emperor in 54, Seneca became his advisor and, together with the
                            praetorian prefect Sextus Afranius Burrus, provided competent government for the first five
                            years of Nero's reign. Seneca's influence over Nero declined with time, and in 65 Seneca was
                            forced to take his own life for alleged complicity in the Pisonian conspiracy to assassinate
                            Nero, in which he was likely to have been innocent. His stoic and calm suicide has become
                            the subject of numerous paintings.

                            As a writer Seneca is known for his philosophical works, and for his plays, which are all
                            tragedies. His prose works include a dozen essays and one hundred twenty-four letters
                            dealing with moral issues. These writings constitute one of the most important bodies of
                            primary material for ancient Stoicism. As a tragedian, he is best known for plays such as
                            his Medea, Thyestes, and Phaedra. Seneca's influence on later generations is immense—during
                            the Renaissance he was "a sage admired and venerated as an oracle of moral, even of
                            Christian edification; a master of literary style and a model [for] dramatic art."

                        <p class="card-text">
                            Epictetus was born around AD 50, presumably at Hierapolis, Phrygia. The name his
                            parents gave him is unknown; the word epíktētos (ἐπίκτητος) in Greek simply means "gained"
                            or "acquired" the Greek philosopher Plato, in his Laws, used the term to mean property
                            that is "added to one's hereditary property" He spent his youth as a slave in Rome to
                            Epaphroditos, a wealthy freedman and secretary to Nero

                            Early in life, Epictetus acquired a passion for philosophy and, with the permission of his
                            wealthy owner, he studied Stoic philosophy under Musonius Rufus Becoming more educated
                            in this way raised his social status. At some point, he became crippled. Origen wrote
                            that this was because his leg had been deliberately broken by his owner. Simplicius, in
                            contrast, wrote that he had simply been lame from childhood.
                            Epictetus obtained his freedom sometime after the death of Nero in AD 68, and he began
                            to teach philosophy in Rome. Around AD 93, when Emperor Domitian banished all philosophers
                            from the city, Epictetus moved to Nicopolis in Epirus, Greece, where he founded a school
                            of philosophy.

                            His most famous pupil, Arrian, studied under him as a young man (around AD 108) and claimed
                            to have written his famous Discourses based on the notes he took on Epictetus’s lectures.
                            Arrian argued that his Discourses should be considered comparable to the Socratic
                            literature. Arrian described Epictetus as a powerful speaker who could "induce his
                            listener to feel just what Epictetus wanted him to feel." Many eminent figures sought
                            conversations with him. Emperor Hadrian was friendly with him, and may have heard
                            him speak at his school in Nicopolis.

                            He lived a life of great simplicity, with few possessions. He lived alone for a long
                            time, but in his old age, he adopted a friend's child who otherwise would have been left
                            to die and raised him with the aid of a woman. It is unclear whether Epictetus and she
                            were married. He died sometime around AD 135. After his death, according to Lucian,
                            his oil lamp was purchased by an admirer for 3,000 drachmae.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            Cleanthes (330 BC – c. 230 BC), of Assos, was a
                            Greek Stoic philosopher and successor to Zeno of Citium as the second head (scholarch) of
                            the Stoic school in Athens. Originally a boxer, he came to Athens where he took up
                            philosophy, listening to Zeno's lectures. He supported himself by working as a water-carrier
                            at night. After the death of Zeno, c. 262 BC, he became the head of the school, a post he
                            held for the next 32 years. Cleanthes successfully preserved and developed Zeno's doctrines.
                            He originated new ideas in Stoic physics, and developed Stoicism in accordance with the
                            principles of materialism and pantheism. Among the fragments of Cleanthes' writings which
                            have come down to us, the largest is a Hymn to Zeus. His pupil was Chrysippus who became one
                            of the most important Stoic thinkers.

                            Cleanthes was born in Assos in the Troad, about 330 BC According to Diogenes
                            Laërtius he was the son of Phanias, and early in life he was a boxer. With but four
                            drachmae in his possession he came to Athens, where he took up philosophy, listening first
                            to the lectures of Crates the Cynic and then to those of Zeno, the Stoic. In order to
                            support himself, he worked all night as water-carrier to a gardener (hence his nickname the
                            Well-Water-Collector, Greek: Φρεάντλης). As he spent the whole day in studying philosophy
                            with no visible means of support, he was summoned before the Areopagus to account for his
                            way of living. The judges were so delighted by the evidence of work which he produced, that
                            they voted him ten minae, though Zeno would not permit him to accept them. His power of
                            patient endurance, or perhaps his slowness, earned him the title of "the Ass" from his
                            fellow students, a name which he was said to have rejoiced in, as it implied that his back
                            was strong enough to bear whatever Zeno put upon it.

                            Such was the esteem awakened by his high moral qualities that, on the death of Zeno in 262
                            BC, he became the leader of the school. He continued, however, to support himself by the
                            labour of his own hands. Among his pupils were his successor, Chrysippus, and Antigonus II
                            Gonatas, from whom he accepted 3000 minae. He died at the age of 99, c. 230 BC We are
                            told that a dangerous ulcer had compelled him to fast for a time. Subsequently he continued
                            his abstinence, saying that, as he was already half-way on the road to death, he would not
                            trouble to retrace his steps
